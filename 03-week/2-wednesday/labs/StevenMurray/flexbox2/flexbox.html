            <p>This was a dark day in our history.</p>
            <p>I will never forget staring at a printout of a database</p>
            <p>schema that I had on my office wall while I was listening to</p>
            <p>the radio and heard that the first tower had collapsed.</p>
            <p>Had I been younger I would have enlisted the next day.</p>
            <p>I remember calling my dad and asking him if he was watching</p>
            <p>the news, when he said he was watching something else, I told</p>
            <p>him to turn Matlock off and turn on the news because we were</p>
            <p>going to war.</p>
